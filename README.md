The **Testimonial Page** is a responsive web page that showcases user reviews and helpful resources for reviewers. It features two testimonial cards with ratings and a structured section outlining tools and checklists for peer reviews. The design emphasizes modern aesthetics and user-friendly layouts to present information effectively.

## What I learned

- **CSS Grid Layout**: I explored CSS Grid to create complex layouts for testimonial cards that adapt seamlessly across different screen sizes.
- **Custom Properties in CSS**: By using CSS variables, I managed styles efficiently, making them reusable and consistent throughout the project.
- **Typography and Hierarchy**: I improved my understanding of typography, learning how to structure headings, body text, and list items for better readability.
- **Media Queries**: I learned to apply responsive design techniques with media queries to ensure the layout works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Accessible HTML**: The project helped me write semantic HTML, improving usability and SEO.
